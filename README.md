raytracer
=========

re-coded raytracer based on rtGPU.

Now coding with c++ in Xcode 4.6.2 (April 24th, 2013), Visual Studio and cmake configuration support is in the plan and may added when basic functions are finished.

I write this code for practicing, learning and sharing with others, I hope the code is helpful to you. You are welcome to use the code in any ways as you like.
However, I may submit this project for the class assignment, if you are going to use the code for the same situation--for the consideration of cheating suspicion--please contact me ahead of time.


Discussions are welcome.
